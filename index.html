<p>I’m a writer and editor based in Whitehorse, Yukon.</p>

<p>I took a roundabout route here. After growing up in Victoria, B.C. and studying English literature and journalism, I traded temperate rainforests for tundra and spent several years in Iqaluit, Nunavut, working as a reporter for <a href="http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca">Nunatsiaq News</a>. I then headed west to work for the <a href="http://yukon-news.com">Yukon News</a> in Whitehorse, first as a reporter and later as the newspaper’s editor.</p>

<p>In 2016, I pulled up stakes and moved to Kingston, Ontario, for four years. During that time I took over the helm of <a href="https://www.newsdeeply.com/arctic">Arctic Deeply</a>, an online news site that specialized in reporting on big issues affecting the circumpolar world. (You can find my stories for Arctic Deeply <a href="https://www.newsdeeply.com/arctic/contributor/john-thompson">here</a>.) In October 2017, I returned to <a href="http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca">Nunatsiaq News</a> as the newspaper’s web editor.</p>

<p>During my run as editor of the <a href="http://yukon-news.com">Yukon News</a> I won national prizes for my editorials on local and national issues. Prior to being thrown into the editor's seat, I picked up a healthy share of awards for <a href="/enterprise">enterprise reporting</a> and <a href="/features">feature writing</a> as a reporter for the <a href="http://yukon-news.com">Yukon News</a> and <a href="http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca">Nunatsiaq News</a>. (I've put together a round-up of award-winning stories <a href="/awards"><b>here</b></a>.)</p>

<p>You'll find here some serious stuff about the North's thorny social and political issues. I've also included some fun stories about <a href="/features/projectile-pukers">projectile-vomiting seabirds</a>, a <a href="/features/boss-dog">legendary sled-dog</a> and my farewell to <a href="/features/kamotiq/">Iqaluit's greasiest diner</a>.</p>

<p>My complete resume is at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johngthompson">LinkedIn</a>. I try to share good reads on <a href="https://twitter.com/jayjeetee">Twitter</a>.</p>
